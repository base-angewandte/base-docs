Welcome to base Angewandte's Documentation!
===========================================

This is the entry point for the documentation of all our applications. While every app has its own specific docs,
here you will find all the things common to our apps:

* how to deploy them in production environments
* how our repositories are structured
* how our APIs work
* how to set up a streamlined local development environment
* how to use some common tools and setups for our existing projects
* how to contribute

If you just want to find out how deploy all those different apps you need on a server, go to the
:ref:`Deployment of base applications` section.

If you want to set up your own system in a way that is streamlined for working on our code base, go the
:ref:`Local dev system setup` section.

If you want to understand how our repositories are structured, how we use different dev tools, or how we and our
projects work together, check out the remaining sections here.
