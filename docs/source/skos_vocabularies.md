# SKOS Vocabularies

Most of our applications use [SKOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Knowledge_Organization_System) vocabularies
for user interface labels as well as semantic concepts identifying entry types and other information.

As a platform to host our curated vocabularies and taxonomies we use the controlled vocabulary browser
[Skosmos](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos). For curating and editing the vocabularies and taxonomies we use
[VocBench](https://vocbench.uniroma2.it/), from which they are exported to our public Skosmos instance running on
https://voc.uni-ak.ac.at/skosmos.

The vocabularies and taxonomies on this platform reflect a curated set of SKOS concepts, which are continuously
extended and maintained in exchange with all partner organisations within the base application ecosystem. While you
could set up your own SKOS server, in most standard use cases we suggest using our public instance.
